# In Octave

In Octave is an HTML5 game that I made in 2018 with [Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js). It is a puzzle/shooter that creates a procedural ambiant music as you play. You can play it on [itch.io](https://itooh.itch.io/in-octave)!

## Installation

- `npm install`
- `npm run start` to launch it on _localhost:1234_
